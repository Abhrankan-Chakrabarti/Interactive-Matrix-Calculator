# Matrix Operations C and C++ Programs

This repository contains C and C++ programs for performing various operations on matrices. The programs provide a simple command-line interface for users to interact with matrices and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication, scalar division, and transposition.

## Programs

### Matrix Calculator (C++ - matrix_calculator.cpp)

This C++ program implements a basic matrix calculator that allows users to perform operations on matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication, scalar division, and transposition. The program provides a menu-driven interface for users to select and perform operations on matrices.

### Matrix Operations Functions (C - matrix_operations.c)

This C program defines functions for performing matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication, scalar division, and transposition. These functions can be reused in other programs or projects that require matrix operations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and the C program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc):

   ```bash
   g++ -o matrix_calculator matrix_calculator.cpp
   gcc -o matrix_operations matrix_operations.c
   ```

3. Run the executables:

   ```bash
   ./matrix_calculator
   ./matrix_operations
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform matrix operations.
